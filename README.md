# introduction
This website is all about me and my interest
#This website is Horizontal Scroll style
-when scroll down it will go to the right and vise versa
-when the width is in mobile layout, an notification will pop-up to tell a person to rotate its phone into landscape mode / horizontal
- It worked but sadly it doesn't go the way I expected
-phones aren't compatible with layout that I intended to make which is sad
# but I learned a lot

what's the purpose of this README?
is this some sort of confession notepad?
